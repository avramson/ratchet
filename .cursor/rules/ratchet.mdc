## Code generation guidelines
- Avoid adding unnecessary comments. Keep the code consice. Only add comments if logic is not obviously clear from the code.
- Think hard about the changes.
- If applicable, always add a small unit-test for the new functionality. Make sure the new unit-tests passes and is fast (use mocks wherever possible).

## Formatting and Linting

Run `just` to format, lint and test code. 

## Commit Style

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style for
commit messages, for example `feat: add new feature` or `fix: correct issue`.
